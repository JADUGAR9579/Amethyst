# Amethyst

**One AI interface to your apps, information, tasks and tools.**

A local-first personal operating system. One FastAPI backend, one React
frontend, one SQLite database — everything stays on your machine.

---

Amethyst runs an agent loop that reasons, acts, and observes — streaming every
turn, tracing every tool call, and asking before anything writes or runs. It
connects to your calendar, mail, tasks, and files; keeps a searchable Library of
everything you save; and works with local models through Ollama for a zero-cost,
zero-cloud setup, or with 20+ cloud providers.

## Features

| | |
|:---|:---|
| <img src="docs/images/view-chat.png" width="480" alt="Main page"> | **Main** — the chat interface with live agent turns, streaming responses and tool traces |
| <img src="docs/images/view-today.png" width="480" alt="Today view"> | **Today** — the whole day on one page: morning briefing, events, what is owed |
| <img src="docs/images/view-tasks.png" width="480" alt="Tasks view"> | **Tasks** — lists and buckets on a board of cards, with a calendar engine that finds free slots and flags conflicts |
| <img src="docs/images/view-library.png" width="480" alt="Library view"> | **Library** — your knowledge vault: tags, grid or list, ask-chat over anything you saved, stored as plain markdown on disk |
| <img src="docs/images/view-memory.png" width="480" alt="Memory view"> | **Memory** — per-conversation extracted memories that persist context across sessions |
| <img src="docs/images/view-plugins-overview.png" width="480" alt="Plugin overview"> | **Plugin Overview** — a birds-eye view of all installed connectors and their status |
| <img src="docs/images/view-plugins.png" width="480" alt="Plugins view"> | **Skills & connectors** — Microsoft To Do, Google Workspace, GitHub, Spotify, and more, installed from one page |
| <img src="docs/images/view-spotlight.png" width="480" alt="Spotlight"> | **Keyboard-first UI** — command palette (`⌘K`), full shortcut reference on `?`, no mouse required |
| <img src="docs/images/view-settings.png" width="480" alt="Settings"> | **Settings** — manage providers, permissions, standing approvals, and preferences |
| <img src="docs/images/turn.png" width="480" alt="Agent turn trace"> | **Live turn trace** — every tool call and argument streams as it happens, so you always know what the agent is doing |

Also: Mail (beta, direct Gmail), Automations (beta, a prompt on an interval), a full Activity log, and a tray + global hotkey desktop mode.

## Enterprise-Grade Reliability

Amethyst's backend is fortified against edge cases, resource leaks, and concurrency issues:

- **Bulletproof concurrency** — A global `.amethyst.lock` file prevents multiple background instances from clobbering each other's ports and logs.
- **Leak-free streaming** — FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` guarantee cleanup of SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections, preventing memory leaks when clients disconnect ungracefully.
- **Orphan process prevention** — Explicit process group reaping ensures that background PTY processes spawned by the terminal manager are killed instantly on shutdown.
- **Strict dependency isolation** — Dynamic skill loading employs robust directory existence validation and YAML mapping verification, preventing malformed skills from crashing the system.

## Premium UI/UX & Motion Design

The interface is built to look and feel stunning:

- **Glassmorphism & Glow** — Soft gradients, blurred backdrops (`backdrop-filter`), and dynamic drop-shadows bring the interface to life.
- **Fluid Motion** — Smooth page transitions (`view-swap`), slide-in sidebars, and refined popover animations make interactions feel purposeful and fast.
- **Responsive Empty States** — Skeleton loaders and carefully crafted empty views provide a polished experience even when there is no data to show.
- **Robust Error Boundaries** — Graceful fallbacks and toast notifications catch unhandled promise rejections and backend warnings without breaking the flow.

## The agent, briefly

- **Reason → act → observe.** The Director picks the tools; you watch it work.
- **Operation-level permissions.** A prompt names the exact operation —
  `write_file`, `run_shell_command:read-only` vs. destructive — and approving a
  read never approves a write. Standing approvals can be revoked anytime in
  Settings.
- **Skills are markdown.** A skill is a plain `SKILL.md` file. No plugins, no
  code lifecycle. Write one in the app, import a link, or install from the
  catalogue.
- **MCP connectors.** Any Model Context Protocol server — stdio, SSE, or
  streamable HTTP — registers into one flat tool registry.
- **Parallel execution.** Run multiple data-gathering tasks simultaneously with
  automatic task name correction and error recovery.
- **Smart file reading.** Binary detection, image handling, pagination, and
  hard limits prevent token explosion and improve performance.

## Quick start

**Fastest path** (macOS / Linux / WSL2 — Windows: `run.bat`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wayn-Git/Amethyst.git
cd Amethyst
./run.sh
```

The script sets up the venv, installs dependencies, initializes the database,
builds the frontend, and opens **http://127.0.0.1:8000**.

**As a desktop application** (after the first run, no terminal needed):

```bash
amethyst desktop                    # launch it -- or use the application menu
amethyst-show                       # raise the window of a running instance
amethyst desktop --install-autostart # start it at login, in the background
amethyst desktop --install-shortcut  # bind a global key to open it
```

Launching twice does not start a second copy; it raises the window of the one
already running. Closing the window puts AMETHYST away rather than quitting it —
schedules, jobs and the agent loop keep running. `amethyst serve` remains the
development command. See [docs/architecture/desktop.md](docs/architecture/desktop.md).

**Docker:**

```bash
docker compose up
```

**Models in two minutes, no API keys:**

```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai, then:
ollama run llama3.2
```

Ollama models appear in the chat model selector automatically. Prefer cloud?
Add a key to `.env` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, …)
or run `./run.sh --setup` for the interactive wizard. See the
[Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) for the full guide, including OAuth connectors and
the Cloudflare relay.

## Models

Works with local Ollama out of the box, plus 21 provider presets: OpenAI,
Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, and more —
or point `providers.yaml` at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Security

- Every tool dispatch passes a permission gate; you approve the *operation*,
  not just the tool.
- Secrets live in the OS keychain, never in the database.
- State is a local SQLite database (WAL mode); Library files are plain
  markdown in `~/.amethyst/library/`.
- Shell tools run sandboxed; the sandbox and permission system are covered by
  the test suite.
